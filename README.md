# CSc 473/578C - Fall 2018 assignment

This is the assignment 1 that implements a Binary Star System with a planet circle around it.

* The labs use CMake, as well as a modified version of the Atlas framework available [here](https://github.com/marovira/atlas)
* The labs are written in C++. This is due to simplicity, but you are not required to use it in your assignments.
